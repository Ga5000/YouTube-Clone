    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>During the development of this YouTube clone project, I gained valuable insights and improved my skills in several areas:</p>

    <h3>Clean Architecture</h3>
    <p>I implemented a clean architecture to organize my project structure effectively. By separating components into logical folders and modules, I achieved better code organization, readability, and maintainability. üèõÔ∏è</p>

    <h3>Effective Use of Props and React Hooks</h3>
    <p>I learned how to make efficient use of React props and hooks to pass data between components, manage component state, and handle side effects. This allowed for a more modular and reusable component structure. ‚öõÔ∏è</p>

    <h3>Fetching Data from API</h3>
    <p>Utilizing the YouTube API, I learned how to make asynchronous requests to fetch video data dynamically. This experience enhanced my understanding of handling API responses, error handling, and optimizing data fetching processes. üåê</p>

    <h3>Clean Code Practices</h3>
    <p>I focused on writing clean and readable code by adhering to best practices and principles. This includes meaningful variable and function naming, avoiding code duplication, and organizing code blocks logically. üßπ</p>

    <h3>CSS Responsivity</h3>
    <p>Ensuring a responsive design was a crucial aspect of this project. I applied CSS media queries and flexbox to create a layout that adapts to various screen sizes, providing a seamless user experience across different devices. üì±</p>
